This is the R markdown file for project 1.

Here are the tables of customers, items, orders, and order details stored in data frames.

```{r}
source("../01 Data/Dataframe call.R", echo = TRUE)
```

Here are the plots for each table:

##Customers##
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

##Items##
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

##Orders##
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

##Order details##
This graph shows the frequency of which each quantity of each item was sold.
EX: One copy of Umani in Concert was ordered 10 times, and two copies of Umani in Comcers were ordered once.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(order_details, aes(x = ITEM_ID, y = ORDER_QTY) ) + stat_sum(aes(group = 1, color = ITEM_ID))
```
